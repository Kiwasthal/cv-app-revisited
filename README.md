# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# About

This is a revisit of the original design of the CV-application built with different React Hooks . The intention is rebuilding the whole application with functional components , using as many new techniques as possible. Press <u>Space</u> to toggle between various themes.

# Notes

The project makes use of :useState,useEffect,useCallback && useRef hooks as well as a number of custom hooks passed around the project to handle various events. The code is a major imporvement in terms of "dryness" and "cleanliness",pruning more than 50% of the original lines, since there were many repeating patterns for functionalities that could be grouped, which overcomplicated and extended the codebase for no apparent reason . In addition to the original design this project makes use of StyledComponent's Theme Provider as well as the useContext Hook to provide the user with the option to toggle between various themes.
